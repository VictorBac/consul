# Compatibility Matrix for Consul Kubernetes and Consul

For every release of Consul Kubernetes, a new version of the Consul Kubernetes
Helm chart and Consul Kubernetes binary is released through the HashiCorp Helm repository. The recommended best practice is to upgrade
the Helm chart which will ensure a compatible version of the Consul Kubernetes binary is used.

## Supported Consul versions

Starting with Consul Kubernetes 0.33.0, Consul Kubernetes versions all of it components with a single version. 

| Consul Version | Compatible consul-k8s Versions  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1.11.x         | 0.39.0 - latest                 |
| 1.10.x         | 0.33.0 - 0.38.0                 |

Prior to Consul Kubernetes 0.33.0, a separately versioned Consul Helm chart was distributed to deploy the Consul on Kubernetes binary. The default version of the `consul-k8s` binary specified by the Helm chart should be used to ensure proper compatibility, since the Helm chart is designed and tested with the default `consul-k8s` version. 

| Consul Version | Compatible Consul Helm Versions |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1.10.x         | 0.32.0 - 0.32.1                 |
| 1.9.x          | 0.27.0 - 0.31.1                 |
| 1.8.x          | 0.22.0 - 0.26.0                 |
| 1.7.x          | 0.17.0 - 0.21.0                 |
| 1.6.x          | 0.10.0 - 0.16.2                 |

## Supported Envoy versions

Supported versions of Envoy for Consul versions are also found in [Envoy - Supported Versions](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#supported-versions). The recommended best practice is to use the default version of Envoy that is provided in the Helm values.yml file, as that is the version that has been tested with the default Consul and Consul Kubernetes binaries for a given Helm chart.

## Supported Vault versions when using Vault as a Secrets Backend 

| Consul Version | Compatiable consul-ks Versions | Compatible Vault Versions | Compatible Vault K8s Versions | 
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------| ----------------------------- |
| 1.11.x         | 0.39.0 - latest                | 1.9.0 - latest            | 0.14.0 - latest               |
