# Compatibility Matrix for Consul on Kubernetes 

For every release of Consul on Kubernetes, a Helm chart, `consul-k8s-control-plane` binary and a `consul-k8s` CLI binary is built and distributed through a single version. When deploying via Helm, the recommended best path for upgrading Consul on Kubernetes, is to upgrade using the same `consul-k8s-control-plane` version as the Helm Chart, as the Helm Chart and Control Plane binary are tightly coupled. 

## Supported Consul versions

Starting with Consul Kubernetes 0.33.0, Consul Kubernetes versions all of it components with a single version. 

| Consul Version | Compatible consul-k8s Versions  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1.11.x         | 0.39.0 - latest                 |
| 1.10.x         | 0.33.0 - 0.38.0                 |

Prior to Consul Kubernetes 0.33.0, a separately versioned Consul Helm chart was distributed to deploy the Consul on Kubernetes binary. The default version of the `consul-k8s` binary specified by the Helm chart should be used to ensure proper compatibility, since the Helm chart is designed and tested with the default `consul-k8s` version. 

| Consul Version | Compatible Consul Helm Versions |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1.10.x         | 0.32.0 - 0.32.1                 |
| 1.9.x          | 0.27.0 - 0.31.1                 |
| 1.8.x          | 0.22.0 - 0.26.0                 |
| 1.7.x          | 0.17.0 - 0.21.0                 |
| 1.6.x          | 0.10.0 - 0.16.2                 |

## Supported Envoy versions

Supported versions of Envoy for Consul versions are also found in [Envoy - Supported Versions](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/proxies/envoy#supported-versions). The recommended best practice is to use the default version of Envoy that is provided in the Helm values.yml file, as that is the version that has been tested with the default Consul and Consul Kubernetes binaries for a given Helm chart.

## Supported Vault versions when using Vault as a Secrets Backend

Starting with Consul K8s 0.39.0 and Consul 1.11.x, Consul Kubernetes supports the ability to utilize Vault as the secrets backend for all the secrets utilized by Consul Kubernetes.  

| Consul Version | Compatiable consul-ks Versions | Compatible Vault Versions | Compatible Vault K8s Versions | 
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------| ----------------------------- |
| 1.11.x         | 0.39.0 - latest                | 1.9.0 - latest            | 0.14.0 - latest               |
